The HiDiMesher project is aimed at implementing an arbitrily high meshing algorithm.

The goal is to use the DeWall implementation of Delaunney Triangulation in order to create a standalone mesher 
for scientific or idustrial software applications. This project is mostly for fun, so don't expect too much 
sophistication ;).
